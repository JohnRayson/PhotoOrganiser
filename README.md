# PhotoOrganiser

An Organiser for photos

Organises photos based on the date / time they were taken.
Designed to take photos from multiple cameras / phones and put them ointo chronological order in a series of structured folders.

Takes photo date / time from 3 sources:
* Exif data
* File data
* File name

Outputs copies of the images into a seperate directory with a sub-directory for each day.

Work to do:

Needs to take the input / output settings from an external source - currently hard coded.
Needs to output the MetaData into a readable file (currently lost on close)
Needs a UI of some sort
Fixed to only work with .jpg images (due to issues with videos), needs to support others
